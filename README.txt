This is a brute force depth first search solution. 
My idea of threading ended up being a micro optimization at best.
I was unable to really find a heuristic for BFS or A*. I know
in the Bell paper a heuristic was discussed, but I didn't 
have the math background to really grasp it. I'm smart, but not clever.
I wasn't clever enough to really hard code in some move sets that could be 
helpful for larger boards, I might pick that up again before the turn in date.
However, in the mean time, I'm going to try to get work for other classes
done.
